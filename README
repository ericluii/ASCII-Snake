			- Refactored Game class to use strategy template to allow
			  easy adding of game modes (ie. 2 player in the future)

01/01/13 EL - Refactored Food Class and Added a FoodContainer Class
			- Optimized a bit by only modifying the board where needed

Next Task:
=================
01/01/13 EL - Refactor snake

			- Port over to other languages/devices

All *.cpp files are commented with details about how the code works.
In the notes section, I have included changes which I plan to implement.

Please give me some credit if you plan to modify the code.
