This was a fun personal project where I created snake
with pure ASCII as the output.

If you want to run it, just go into terminal and type:
./executableSnake in the folder which you downloaded the source code.
Or you can recompile all the files yourself.

All *.cpp files are commented with details about how the code works.
In the notes section, I have included changes which I plan to implement.

Future updates beyond changing the way it is implementation:
- 2 player snake
- port over to other languages/devices

Please give me some credit if you plan to modify the code.
