This was a fun personal project where I created snake
with pure ASCII as the output.

Changelog:
=================
01/01/13 EL - Began refactoring code
			- Refactored Game class to use strategy template to allow
			  easy adding of game modes (ie. 2 player in the future)

Next Task:
=================
01/01/13 EL - Refactor food and snake
			- Update to use SDL framework to use graphics
			- Port over to other languages/devices

All *.cpp files are commented with details about how the code works.
In the notes section, I have included changes which I plan to implement.

Please give me some credit if you plan to modify the code.
